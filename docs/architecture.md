# **Architecture Overview**

### **Components**
- **Frontend**: The user interface where users interact with.
    - **Content Aggregation**: Fetches news articles using NewsAPIs.
    - **Data Normalization**: Normalizes data from different sources into a consistent format for easier consumption by the frontend.
    - **State Management**: Utilizes Redux to manage logged user, user preferences and fetched articles.

### **Data Flow**
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the frontend to customize their news feed.
2. **API Requests**: The frontend sends requests to the backend API to fetch or update user preferences and articles.
3. **Data Fetching**: The backend aggregates news articles from third-party sources and normalizes the data.
4. **Response**: The backend sends the formatted articles back to the frontend, which displays them to the user.

### **Backend Architecture**
- **API Layer**: Handles incoming requests from the frontend and routes them to the appropriate services.
- **Service Layer**: Contains the business logic for fetching, normalizing, and storing news articles.
- **Database Layer**: Manages the storage of user preferences.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: Vite + React for building the user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user preferences.
- **External APIs**: NewsAPI and other news sources for fetching articles.

### **Deployment**
- **Hosting**: The application is not hosted yet, but it could be hosted on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku) easily.
- **CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are set up using tools like GitHub Actions.

### **Security Considerations**
- **Authentication**: User authentication is handled using JWT tokens.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API.

### **Scalability**
- **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances of the backend.
- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce the load on external APIs and improve response times.
